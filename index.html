          <p>
            <b>Abdul Sattar Edhi was a Pakistani philanthropist who built a nationwide network of
              humanitarian centres offering a wide range of life-saving services to the people of Pakistan.
              Edhi began his humanitarian work in 1947, soon after partition, with just $500. 
              Over the next decades, he helped to save the lives of at least 50,000 babies and
              created a fleet of 1,800 ambulances, 28 rescue boats and two airplanes to help in emergencies.
